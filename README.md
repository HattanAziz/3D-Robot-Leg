# 3D-Robot-Leg
Design the legs of a three-dimensional robot with a height of 64 cm , In the course of mechanical engineering ,

I used https://www.tinkercad.com/ to design the Robot Leg 
If you don't know how to design Tte website will give you a short tutorial 
its easy to design 

- The first step in designing a leg is the foot or the (shoe)

- The second step is to design a base for fixing the foot

- The third step is to design the knee or a joint to fix the lower side

- The fourth step is to establish a base for me to stabilize everything below and balance

- The fifth step is to design for the second time the knee and design with the same sizes

- The sixth step, the easiest step, is to copy the entire figure and place it next to the first leg, and it will be of the same sizes and proximity

- Finally, design the fixed part on top of the design
